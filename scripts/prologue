[skip to module list](#module-list)

Salsa20 is a widely used stream cipher designed for fast and secure encryption. This project contains a pure Haskell implementation of the Salsa20 cipher, organized into several sub-modules.

The implementation is organized into the following modules:

- 'Quarterround': Defines the quarterround operation used in the Salsa20 cipher.
- 'Rowround': Implements the rowround operation, a component of the Salsa20 cipher.
- 'Columnround': Implements the columnround operation, treating it as rowround expressions with the input transposed.
- 'Doubleround': Defines the doubleround function as the composition of rowround and columnround. Also, provides a variant 'doubleroundR' for a specified number of rounds.
- 'Hash': Implements the Salsa20 core function and the extended hash expressions.
- 'Utils': Provides utility functions used in the Salsa20 cipher, such as little-endian encoding, matrix operations, and reduction functions.
- 'Expansion': Implements functions for Salsa20 key expansion and matrix generation.
- 'Crypt': Provides functions for Salsa20 encryption and decryption.

The Salsa20 cipher itself is a stream cipher that operates on 64-byte blocks, producing a keystream that is XORed with the plaintext to generate ciphertext. It is known for its efficiency and security.

For usage instructions and additional details, refer to the documentation in each module.
